# A short R Markdown example

A quote:

> R Markdown provides an authoring framework for data science.

To compile this, just click the `Knit` button in R Studio.
You can actually see it rendered [here](https://github.com/37chandler/ada-first-class/blob/master/R%20Markdown%20Example.Rmd).

## code chunks

A _paragraph_ here. A code chunk below (remember the three backticks):

```{r}
1+1
.4-.7+.3 # what? it is not zero!
```

## graphics

Graphics are pretty easy.

```{r}
data(mtcars)
plot(mtcars$disp,mtcars$mpg)
hist(rnorm(1000))
```

## inline code

Inline code is designated by single backticks. So we made that
`mtcars` plot with `plot(mtcars$disp,mtcars$mpg)`. 

## math

Sigh. You cannot live without math equations. OK, here we go: $\alpha+\beta=\gamma$. Note this is not supported by native markdown. You probably want to try RStudio, or at least the R package **markdown**, or the function `knitr::knit2html()`.

## nested code chunks

You can write code within other elements, e.g. a list

1. Here's one item. 
    ```{r}
    strsplit('hello indented world', ' ')[[1]]
    ```
2. And here's another.

Or inside blockquotes:

> Here is a quote, followed by a code chunk:
>
> ```{r}
> x = 1:10
> rev(x^2)
> ```

## conclusion

We'll do more of this, but now you've got an example. 

There's a comprehensive introduction on the R Studio
R Markdown [site](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html).
